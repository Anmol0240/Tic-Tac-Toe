![Tic Tac Toe Banner](https://stastic.ui4free.com/public/images/free-figma-game-tic-tac-toe_1635143619.jpg)

Welcome to my **first-ever JavaScript project**! 🙌  
This is a classic **Tic Tac Toe** (also called "X & O") game built using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. I made this project as part of my learning journey to understand how DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic works in JS.

## 🧠 What I Learned

🔹 JavaScript DOM manipulation  
🔹 Adding event listeners  
🔹 Creating and using functions  
🔹 Working with arrays and conditions  
🔹 Basic UI/UX styling using CSS  
🔹 Making a responsive and interactive webpage

```

## 🎮 How It Works

- Two players take turns: `O` starts first.
- Click on a box to place your symbol.
- Once a winning combination is detected, a message shows the winner.
- You can click **Reset** or **New Game** to start over.

The game checks for these winning combinations:

```js
[0,1,2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8],
[0,3,6], [1,4,7], [2,5,8],
[0,4,8], [2,4,6]
```
